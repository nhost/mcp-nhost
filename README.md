## Installing

To install mcp-nhost, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/mcp-nhost/main/get.sh | bash
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade mcp-nhost, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo mcp-nhost upgrade --confirm
```

## Getting Started

After installing mcp-nhost, you will need to do two things to get things up and running:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your Nhost account.
2. Configure your mcp-nhost client (i.e. Cursor, etc.)

### Create a PAT

In order to use mcp-nhost, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your Nhost account. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to https://app.nhost.io/account
2. Scroll don to "Personal Access Tokens" and create a new token. Write down the token as you will need it later.
3. Proceed to configure your mcp-nhost client (instructions for some below).

### Configuring clients

The examples below enable mutations against the cloud and your projects via the flags `--with-cloud-mutations` and `--with-project-mutations`. If you want to disable these, you can remove the flags from the snippets below.

#### Cursor

1. Go to "Cursor Settings"
2. Click on "MCP"
3. Click on "+ Add new global MCP server"
4. Add the following object inside `"mcpServers"`:

```json
    "mcp-nhost": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-nhost",
      "args": [
        "start",
        "--with-cloud-mutations"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NHOST_PAT": "<here-goes-your-pat>"
      }
    }
```
